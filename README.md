# utterance-level-modelling-experimental

This repo contains the experimental version of the paper "utterance-level modelling in self-supervised speech representation learning" or the Msc thesis by Kasidit Tipayawatn from the University of Edinburgh. The utterance-level modelling module emphasizes utterance-level information within frame-level features from a self-supervised SRL(Autoregressive Predictive Coding), as well as explicitly learns an utterance-level embedding. The utterance-level modelling shows positive impact on various downstream tasks including speech recognition and speaker identification.
